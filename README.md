# Moodle-Grade-Scraper

This program is a moodle grade scraper for me. The scraping is done using Selenium using a Firefox browser for Windows builds. In order to work around Linux, a Saucelabs tunnel/server is in use for Travis tests.
The GUI is made using Kivy for Python.

As my credentials are omitted from the code, the program will not pull grades unless a student enters credentials for their Moodle account. Sorry, Joe; I have Gifs that should show operation below:
