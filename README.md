# Moodle-Grade-Scraper

This program is a moodle grade scraper for me. The scraping is done using Selenium using a Firefox browser for Windows builds. In order to work around Linux, a Saucelabs tunnel/server is in use for Travis tests.
The GUI is made using Kivy for Python.

The two following gifs show headless and full mode of the program, respectively.
